# Numberwang

The Numberwang crate is a library of custom number types and functionality,
including variable-bit-width integers.

It is named after the fictitious game show "Numberwang", which is a running joke
in the British sketch comedy show *That Mitchell and Webb Look*. The name was
chosen because the crate is all about numbers.
